# REGRESSION
A python code to optimise energy output from wave energy converters using their locations. The program utilizes multivariate regression and neural networks to train and test the data. Considering the structure of the data set, the code included is written for one city ie Sydney however, the same code is applied to the rest of the cities for complete analysis.  
## Getting started
